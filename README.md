# Audio-Background-Noise-Suppression

Real applications have to recognize audio even when there are other irrelevant sounds happening in the environment. The audio files from the call center are full of background noise, to be able to convert call audio from call center to transcription accurately, it is important to remove or reduce the background noise from the audio.  

## Types of Noise
Stationary or static noise is typical when there is a low volume background sound present in an audio signal. This noise is typically consistent across the entirety of a piece of media because the source of the sound doesnâ€™t change.

There are a number of things that could cause a stationary sound:

* the audio equipment itself, such as a microphone hiss or electric hum of a power-line frequency
* a computer fan running in the background
* a heating or air conditioning unit circulating air

Detecting this type of noise reduction can be done through an analysis of the sound characteristics such as variations in frequencies over time for any hums, buzzes, and other white noise that distracts from the high-value content. There are different techniques for this type of digital signal processing to remove or subtract this type of noise.

Non-Stationary or non-static noise comes from less common sounds that appear infrequently or at a cyclical time.

The examples of non-stationary sounds is considerably more varied:

* a dog barking
* birds chirping
* keyboard clicking
* an ambulance driving by
* book falling off a desk

These sounds are unwanted, but not easy to detect from the sound profile itself. Another way to think of it is the inverse of how to look at stationary sounds. Instead of detecting noise, we use machine learning algorithms that know how to elevate the sounds desired through speech isolation of spoken words in certain types of media.

## 1. Preparation of Dataset
Main dataset are produced from Cantonese Youtube videos that are downloaded and converted to WAV files.  

###  1. Add random segment of environmental audio to the audio
A folder of background noise WAV file from Microsoft Scalable Noisy Speech Dataset (MS-SNSD) [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/MS-SNSD) with white noise and recordings of machinery and everyday household activities are used in this analysis to add noises on the cantonese audio. The loudness of the background noise are used in 5 levels, with 00 the largest and 40 the smallest. 
Since the sample rate are different from the main dataset (16 kHz instead of 44.1 kHz), it will required further process to combine the two audios.

## 3. Check the performance
  ### 1. Google Speech-to-text
  ### 2. Signal-to-noise ratio

## 4. Elaborate the use case with Google cloud NLP API

## 5. Next Steps
Slow down the speed of audio to check if it can be transcribed more accurately.
